**OVERVIEW**

The scrip will collect and clean of multiple data sets and then create a tidy data set of of the merge file which is used for analysis.  
A full description of data sets can be found at:

**Project Summary**  

Following is steps to do this project:  

1/- Create a new repo in Github called Getting-and-Cleaning_Data-Project.  
2/- Clone this repos to your default folder using Git bash.  
3/- Create a script file called run_analysis.R to do:  

3.1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
3.2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.  
3.3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.  
3.4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.  
3.5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  

4/- Create a code Book called CodeBook.md to describe the variables, the data, and work that you performed to clean up the data.  
5/- Create a README.md to explain how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.  
6/- Using Git Bash, to add, commit and push these 3 files run_analysis.R, CodeBook.md and README.md to the repos Getting-and-Cleaning_Data-Project in Github.  
7/- Finally, will review peer project assignments.
